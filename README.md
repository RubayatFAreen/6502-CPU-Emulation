This project involves the development of an emulator for the 6502 microprocessor, a popular 8-bit microprocessor used in many classic computers and gaming consoles. The emulator is written in C++ and accurately replicates the functionality and behavior of the original 6502 microprocessor.

Key Features:

Instruction Set Implementation: The emulator fully supports the 6502 instruction set, including all addressing modes.

Memory Management: Emulation of the microprocessor's memory architecture, including RAM, ROM, and I/O space.

CPU Cycle Accuracy: Ensures that the timing and cycles for each instruction are accurately modeled.

Debugging Tools: Includes features like step-by-step execution, breakpoints, and memory inspection to aid in debugging and development.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The emulator is designed to run on multiple operating systems, taking advantage of C++'s portability.
